    "\n",
    "To get started, read the [Introduction to Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), which is the first file in `Examples`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get used to dealing with notebooks and data download this [notebook](https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/bads/data-challenges-resources/-/blob/main/Pandas-DataFrames/05-PandasWeather.ipynb) and [data file](https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/bads/data-challenges-resources/-/blob/main/Pandas-DataFrames/IDV60901.94866.csv), and then upload the notebook to Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface for Colab is fairly similar to Jupyter, and most of the commands that you use in Jupyter are transferrable to Colab. At the top there are two buttons: **+Code** and **+Text**, to add Python code and Markdown text respectively. When you are editing a cell, there is a menubar of useful commands that appears in the upper right-hand side of the cell. While when your are editing a text cell, there is a second menubar which appears at the upper left-hand side of the cell and a real-time preview on the right-hand side. This preview can be toggled, so it is below the Markdown code. The completion feature for editing of code is particularly useful. This will suggest possible completions for functions and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left of each cell, you will see an arrowhead in a circle to run the cell. Press this and once the cell calculations have been completed a green tick will appear, along with the time taken to run the cell. Alternatively, you can run a cell by focussing on the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`. You can also use the commands in the **Runtime** menu to run individual cells, or run all of the cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the first cell of the notebook and try to run all the cells. You should get an error that it can't find the data file. Goto the left-side panel and click on the folder icon. That will open an interface which shows a folder called _sample_data_, and three icons above this. Click on **Upload** and upload the csv file you previously downloaded. You might get a warning that the data will only be available for this session. Once the file is uploaded, click on the three dots at the side and select **Copy path**, then paste this in the `pd.read_csv` command that failed. You should now get that the path has _/content/_ prepended to the filename. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now try running the notebook again. It should run without any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shell escapes are commands which are preceeded by a `!`. These run shell commands which interact with the computer's operating system, rather than Python commands. On Colab these are Unix or Linux commands.\n",

    "in a cell, it will give you the name of the current directory or folder that you are working in. This should return _/content_, which is the default directory that Colab opens in. Now we can open files by giving their absolute or relative path. Just before we gave the absolute path, i.e., the path from the top of the directory structure, which always starts with _/_. The relative path is the path relative to the current directory, this will not include _/_ at the beginning. Since the file _IDV60901.94866.csv_ is in the current directory, we could use just this field to open the file. Change `pd.read_csv('/content/IDV60901.94866.csv')` to `pd.read_csv('IDV60901.94866.csv')` and rerun the notebook. \n",

    "\n",
    "    cht = pd.read_csv('sample_data/IDV60901.94866.csv')\n",

    "\n",

    "To change back to the original directory you can use (the double dots represent the parent directory of the current directory)\n",
